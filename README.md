## Hack.chat bot
To run:  

+ install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/)
+ navigate to /source in project
+ execute `npm install` on the command line
+ create a source/conig.json that resembles sampleConfig.json
+ execute `node main.js` in /source directory

Admin commands (and normal commands) can be typed into the node console. (admin commands are ones where property `hidden = true`).  
Add your trip to config.authedTrips to make yourself an admin.  
This code is becoming messy because I wrote much of it before I knew a lot about javascript. I am probably going to abandon this project in a few weeks.
